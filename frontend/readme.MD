1. In this frontend component we are creating the pod which is smallest deployment unit and inside the pod the container is created, the container consists of base image of our application we are taking the image-name here as maheswari450/frontend-optimise:v1 from docker hub and adding the image-name inside container 
2. creating the replicas here like if we keep replicas as 1 only one pod will run and if we delete the pod the replica will create the new pod again so here replica here is used to match the pods mentioned in replicas. to create replicas pod labels should match with replicas than only replicas will be created
3. creating the deployment here and attaching the replicas and pods to it so here deployment is used bcoz it will be updated with the latest images if there is any change in the image using pods the image will not be updated automatically,replicaset will use the old image for the pod
4. in order to make pod to pod communication we are creating the service and adding the port of frontend component inside service with port 8080 as targetPort bcoz port 80 is reserved port so we can't use directly so adding 8080 as targetport and service port can be anything so keeping 80 as the service port and here this is frontend so exposing the application to outside world using loadbalancer with type as LoadBalancer
5. here targetport number 80 can't be used so keeping the targetport as 8080 and that need to be changed in nginx.conf if we change the port in nginx.conf again we need to build the image for frontend so here we are using configMap and keeping the nginx.conf inside configMap with the changed port number here by keeping this it will override with the nginx.conf exist before and keep this new nginx.conf with the changed port number and passing this to the container inside pod by creating this data in volume and mounting the volume to the container inside pod.
6. keeping the resource in roboshop namespace here
